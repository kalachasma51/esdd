Aptitude - Number System
Numbers
In Decimal number system, there are ten symbols namely 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 called digits. A
number is denoted by group of these digits called as numerals.
Face Value
Face value of a digit in a numeral is value of the digit itself. For example in 321, face value of 1 is
1, face value of 2 is 2 and face value of 3 is 3.
Place Value
Place value of a digit in a numeral is value of the digit multiplied by 10n where n starts from 0. For
example in 321:
• Place value of 1 = 1 x 100 = 1 x 1 = 1
• Place value of 2 = 2 x 101 = 2 x 10 = 20
• Place value of 3 = 3 x 102 = 3 x 100 = 300
0th position digit is called unit digit and is the most commonly used topic in
aptitude tests.
Types of Numbers
1. Natural Numbers - n > 0 where n is counting number; [1,2,3...]
2. Whole Numbers - n ≥ 0 where n is counting number; [0,1,2,3...].
0 is the only whole number which is not a natural number.
Every natural number is a whole number.
3. Integers - n ≥ 0 or n ≤ 0 where n is counting number;...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3...
are integers.
• Positive Integers - n > 0; [1,2,3...]
• Negative Integers - n < 0; [-1,-2,-3...]
• Non-Positive Integers - n ≤ 0; [0,-1,-2,-3...]
• Non-Negative Integers - n ≥ 0; [0,1,2,3...]
0 is neither positive nor negative integer.
4. Even Numbers - n / 2 = 0 where n is counting number; [0,2,4,...]
5. Odd Numbers - n / 2 ≠ 0 where n is counting number; [1,3,5,...]
6. Prime Numbers - Numbers which is divisible by themselves only apart from 1.
1 is not a prime number.
To test a number p to be prime, find a whole number k such that k > √p. Get
all prime numbers less than or equal to k and divide p with each of these
prime numbers. If no number divides p exactly then p is a prime number
otherwise it is not a prime number.
Example: 191 is prime number or not?
Solution:
Step 1 - 14 > √191
Step 2 - Prime numbers less than 14 are 2,3,5,7,11 and 13.
Step 3 - 191 is not divisible by any above prime number.
Result - 191 is a prime number.
Example: 187 is prime number or not?
Solution:
Step 1 - 14 > √187
Step 2 - Prime numbers less than 14 are 2,3,5,7,11 and 13.
Step 3 - 187 is divisible by 11.
Result - 187 is not a prime number.
7. Composite Numbers- Non-prime numbers > 1. For example, 4,6,8,9 etc.
1 is neither a prime number nor a composite number.
2 is the only even prime number.
8. Co-Primes Numbers - Two natural numbers are co-primes if their H.C.F. is
1. For example, (2,3), (4,5) are co-primes.

Tips on Division
1. If a number n is divisible by two co-primes numbers a, b then n is divisible by ab.
2. (a-b) always divides (an- bn) if n is a natural number.
3. (a+b) always divides (an- bn) if n is an even number.
4. (a+b) always divides (an+ bn) if n is an odd number.
Division Algorithm
When a number is divided by another number then
Dividend = (Divisor x Quotient) + Reminder
Series
Following are formulaes for basic number series:
1. (1+2+3+...+n) = (1/2)n(n+1)
2. (12+22+32+...+n2) = (1/6)n(n+1)(2n+1)
3. (13+23+33+...+n3) = (1/4)n2(n+1)2
Basic Formulaes
These are the basic formulae:
(a + b)2 = a2 + b2 + 2ab
(a - b)2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab
(a + b)2 - (a - b)2 = 4ab
(a + b)2 + (a - b)2 = 2(a2 + b2)
(a2 - b2) = (a + b)(a - b)
(a + b + c)2 = a2 + b2 + c2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)
(a3 + b3) = (a + b)(a2 - ab + b2)
(a3 - b3) = (a - b)(a2 + ab + b2)
(a3 + b3 + c3 - 3abc) = (a + b + c)(a2 + b2 + c2 - ab - bc - ca)
